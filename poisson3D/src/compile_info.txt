# The first step is to compile all the *.c scripts in ../lib/ directory

rm *.o *.a   # remove existing *.o and *.a files
gcc -Wall -c *.c -w    # the -w option is to ignore warnings

# then we create a static library file that links together all the *.o files in the ../lib/ directory

ar -cvq libutil.a *.o

# finally, we compile all the *.c codes in the ../src/ directory and provide the link to the static library file

gcc -o run main.c boundary_functions.c parameters_and_boundary_types.c ../lib/libutil.a
